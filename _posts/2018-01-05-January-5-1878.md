My Darling Emily,  

What ever possessed me, last night, to think of the “Three Lovers?”  I don’t know, but I found it this morning and copied it.  Did I muse on the possibility of breaking my watch at noon?  Or your breaking yours?  I can’t now tell what I thought – I reckon I didn’t know then.  The lines are pretty, tho’, and were translated by a friend of mine, (a gentleman in this office) many years ago.  Of course I had no idea of death.  I suppose my mind ran into the groove that if anything happened to my watch at winding you would have learned to love some other fellow.  But nothing will happen – not to your watch at winding.  I shall never change except to think more and more of you constantly.  

I’m going to ride Prince this afternoon – I’m going across the Bay.  It’s a charming day, and I’ll look at the pretty places over there and wish one of them was mine, and a darling girl living there wishing and waiting my return.  I’ll have a good time for fanciful reflections.  

Tomorrow, Sunday, I’ll write you a little bit of a letter.  I couldn’t help writing this today.  
I think of you so much that I must write once in a while, at odd times.  – Don’t forget that I love you, my darling.  

Faithfully, J.S.R.
