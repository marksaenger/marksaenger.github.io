San Francisco, Christmas - 1877  

My dear Emily--  

Christmas gift!  That’s what we used to say when I was a boy, but I believe it is “A Merry Christmas.”  All right—either is good, and I sent my compliments by telegraph last night, with instructions to have the telegram delivered to you early this morning.  I hoped it would be sent so early that it would be sent to your room before rising, this being your first greeting.  Tell me all about it.  

Yesterday I received your very agreeable and charming letter of 17th.  Did you know you wrote such splendid letters before I told you?  You do write nice, elegantly expressed letters, but you don’t send them often enough.  I’d like to get two, anyhow, each week, and more if you would let me.  

I received letters, also, from Mrs. Lofland and Mrs. Fox.  My compliments to them please.  

I only send you this to be writing to you on Christmas day.  Sunday, at farthest, I shall write you again.  But in the meantime be perfectly confident that I am yours, perfectly, devotedly, and think of you all the time, and only change the before-expressed sentiment so much as to like you more and more each and every day of my life.  Believe that, dear Emily, for I wouldn’t say it if not true.  

Faithfully, J.S.R.
