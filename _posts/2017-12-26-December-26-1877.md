Dear Sir:  

I am inclined to think that I would prefer, if feasible, to carry out my original idea, namely, to get a small place in the neighborhood of Brays.  As you said you would build me a house, I would like to ask if it would be practicable to get say, a quarter of an acre, or a little less, maybe adjoining the Judge Earl place and have a small house of about six or seven rooms built upon it.  A house something about the size and style of the one I saw on 12th Avenue, changed somewhat to suit my notions, would be about the thing.  As the land around Brays is cheaper than on 12th Avenue, I have thought that such an arrangement might be effected for, say, $3000.  I would pay $1000 down if we could agree on terms, etc.  

If we make the trade the place will be occupied by as nice people as any in the state.  

At your convenience please drop me a line saying whether or not such a proposition can be carried into effect, and I will try and see you soon more in detail if favorably answered.  

Mr. E. G. Matthews, Brooklyn  

Yours truly,  
Jos. S. Roberson
