Dear ---(?)  

By Tuesday morning’s express I will send a package addressed to you.  Please---
---(?) the ---(?) covering and you will find two smaller parcels, one addressed  “Mrs. J.M. Fox, 14 Nicholson Place”, the other “Miss Emily Lofland, first house south of Orphans Home, on Grand Avenue, near the end of Lafayette Ave.”   Please have both delivered before Christmas, if possible.  It is a long way out to Miss Loflands, and I will thank you to expense one for the “extra delivery”, and also advise one promptly who signs for each of the parcels.  

Very Truly Yours  
Jos. S. Roberson
