Dear Mrs. Lofland:  

I have Mr. Reed's reply, enclose it and trust the information as to whereabouts, etc., of your friends may be satisfactory.  If I can be of any service in California please command me.  

Today I have been so bold as to write to Miss Lofland, and in the letter have expressed a desire to correspond with her, if she is willing and there is no objection made by yourself or Mr. Lofland.  

May I hope for a favorable decision?  

Very Respectfully Yours,  
Jos. S. Roberson
