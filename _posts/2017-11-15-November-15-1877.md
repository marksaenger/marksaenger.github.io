Dear friend Genl Smith ~  

I have been at home two weeks, but I did not forget the photograph. It was only finished last night.  When Miss Bettie and Miss Sed ~ (I can’t know them by any other names,) return I wish you would present my kindest regards and ask them to send one of their photographs as they appear now.  Also please say that I regret exceedingly not having met them at Sedalia.  The principal reason I stopped there was to see you and your daughters.  I prize the picture you gave me of yourself more than any I have.  In addition to being a very fine likeness it is pronounced by every one who has seen it to be that of a very handsome gentleman.  

I have thought a good deal of what you told me of fathers treatment of you in regard to the $1000 endorsement you had to pay for him.  It pains me to the heart to think he has grown so indifferent to all obligations, but I am persuaded the fault is not chargeable so much to him as to his better half, who—I believe—rules him in everything.  They treated me the same way some five years ago.  

With my best wishes, believe me;  

Very Truly Yours,  
Jos. S. Roberson
